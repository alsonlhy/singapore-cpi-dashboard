## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based project that analyzes consumer price index (CPI) data and average prices of consumer goods in Singapore. The goal of this analysis is to standardize, clean, and merge datasets to calculate real prices for various consumer items over time, adjusted for inflation.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, standardizes data series, and ensures consistent formatting.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts wide-format data into long-format for easier analysis.
- **Merging Datasets**: Combines CPI data with consumer item price data to calculate real prices.
- **Output**: Generates a cleaned and merged dataset (`tableau_data.csv`) for visualization and further analysis.

## Files in the Repository
### 1. `SG-CPI-analysis_cleaned.py`
This is the main Python script that performs the following tasks:
- Reads raw datasets (`Consumer_Items_Avg.csv` and `cpi_2019base.csv`).
- Standardizes data series using a mapping dictionary.
- Cleans and reshapes the datasets into long format.
- Merges the CPI data with consumer price data.
- Calculates real prices by adjusting nominal prices using CPI values.
- Outputs the final dataset as `tableau_data.csv`.

### 2. `Consumer_Items_Avg.csv`
A dataset containing average monthly prices of various consumer items from 2010 to 2024. Each row represents a specific item, and columns represent monthly prices.

### 3. `cpi_2019base.csv`
A dataset containing monthly CPI values for different categories of goods and services.

### 4. `tableau_data.csv`
The output file generated by the script. It contains:
- Nominal Prices
- Real Prices (adjusted for inflation)
- CPI values
- Year and Month
- Standardized Series names

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SG-CPI-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Usage
1. Place the raw datasets (`Consumer_Items_Avg.csv` and `cpi_2019base.csv`) in the same directory as `SG-CPI-analysis_cleaned.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python SG-CPI-analysis_cleaned.py
   ```
3. The cleaned and merged dataset will be saved as `tableau_data.csv` in the same directory.

## How It Works
1. **Standardization**: The script uses a predefined mapping dictionary to group similar items under standardized categories (e.g., "Bread" includes "Ordinary White Bread," "Vitamin Enriched Bread," etc.).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values are filled with median values, and non-numeric entries are coerced into numeric format.
3. **Data Transformation**: Converts wide-format data (columns for each month) into long-format (rows for each month).
4. **Merging**: Combines price data with CPI data based on standardized series, year, and month.
5. **Real Price Calculation**: Uses the formula:
   $$
   \text{Real Price} = \frac{\text{Nominal Price}}{\text{CPI}} \times 100
   $$

## Example Output (from `tableau_data.csv`)
| DataSeries             | Nominal Price | Real Price | CPI    | Year | Month | StandardSeries |
|------------------------|---------------|------------|--------|------|-------|----------------|
| Ordinary White Bread   | 2.23          | 1.95       | 114.5  | 2024 | 12    | Bread          |
| Premium Thai Rice      | 13.82         | 12.08      | 114.3  | 2024 | 12    | Rice           |
| Lean Pork, Chilled     | 16.34         | 14.29      | 114.4  | 2024 | 12    | Pork, Chilled  |

## Applications
- **Inflation Analysis**: Understand how inflation affects consumer goods over time.
- **Policy Insights**: Provide insights for policymakers on price trends.
- **Visualization**: Use the cleaned dataset in tools like Tableau or Power BI for interactive dashboards.
